        "question": "How can I maintain my five daily prayers when traveling or at work?",
        "answer": "Prayer (Salah) can be combined and shortened while traveling according to Islamic law. For work, try to schedule breaks around prayer times, find a quiet space, or make up missed prayers when possible. Many workplaces now provide prayer rooms, and you have the right to request reasonable religious accommodations."

        "question": "What breaks my fast during Ramadan besides eating and drinking?",
        "answer": "While eating and drinking are obvious fast-breakers, other actions that invalidate the fast include: intentional vomiting, intimate relations during daylight hours, smoking, and receiving nutrients through IV (though necessary medical injections are permitted). Unintentional actions like swallowing water while washing for wudu don't break the fast."
