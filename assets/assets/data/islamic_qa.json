            "answer": "Hadith Guidance:\nIn Islam, divorce is considered permissible but it should be the last resort after all efforts to reconcile have been exhausted. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of maintaining family ties and resolving conflicts amicably. In the situation of a pregnant wife and irreconcilable differences, it is important to seek counseling and mediation to try to resolve the issues. Divorcing a pregnant wife should not be taken lightly due to the emotional and physical challenges she is facing. Based on the hadiths provided, we can draw the following guidance: The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) demonstrated patience, kindness, and mercy in his interactions with people. This serves as a model for us to deal with difficulties in a compassionate manner. The incident at Hudaibiya shows that even in challenging situations, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) sought solutions that were beneficial for all involved. This teaches us to approach problems with wisdom and foresight. If after sincere efforts at reconciliation, the differences remain irreconcilable and the marriage is causing harm to both parties, divorce may be considered as a last resort. However, it is recommended to involve a knowledgeable person or a religious counselor to guide the process and ensure that the rights of both parties, including the unborn child, are protected. Ultimately, divorce should be approached with sadness and regret, recognizing that it is a serious matter with consequences for all involved. May Allah grant wisdom and guidance in making difficult decisions.",

But if there are [only] daughters, two or more, for them is two thirds of one's estate. And if there is only one, for her is half. And for one's parents, to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children. But if he had no children and the parents [alone] inherit from him, then for his mother is one third. But if he has brothers [or sisters], for his mother is a sixth, after any bequest he [may have] made or debt. Your parents or your children - you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit. [These shares are] an obligation [imposed] by Allah. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.\" This verse outlines the distribution of inheritance among children and parents.\n- Verse 4:176: \"They ask you, [O Muhammad], about the one [who dies] without a will and without an heir. Say, 'Allah is an authority over him concerning that.' If a man dies and leaves no children but has a sister, she will get one-half of what he left, and he is her heir if she leaves no children. But if there are two sisters, they will get two-thirds of what he left. And if there are brothers and sisters, the male will get the share of two females.

One is polygyny where a man marries more than one woman, and the other is polyandry, where a woman marries more than one man. In Islam, limited polygyny is permitted; whereas polyandry is completely prohibited. Qur’an is the only religious book on the face of the earth that says 'Marry Only One'. The context of this phrase is the following verse from Surah Al Nisaa’ of the Glorious Qur’an: 'Marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one...' [Al-Qur’an 4:3]. In the same chapter i.e. Surah Al Nisaa’ verse 129 says: 'Ye are never able to be fair and just as between women, even if it is your ardent desire: But turn not away (from a woman) altogether, so as to leave her (as it were) hanging (in the air). If ye come to a friendly understanding, and practise self-restraint, Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.' [Al-Qur’an 4:129]. Therefore polygyny is not a rule but an exception.

[Al-Qur’an 24:30] The moment a man looks at a woman and if any brazen or unashamed thought comes to his mind, he should lower his gaze. The next verse of Surah Al Noor, says: 'And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands’ fathers, their sons, their husbands’ sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women.

And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.\" This verse emphasizes the importance of treating wives with kindness and respect.\n- Verse 33:32: \"O wives of the Prophet, you are not like any other women. If you fear Allah, then do not be soft in speech [to men], lest he in whose heart is disease should covet, but speak with appropriate speech.\" This verse highlights the importance of appropriate speech and behavior.",
